# DUSTY 
*Combination of tools for DAST Scanning*

[![](https://dockerbuildbadges.quelltext.eu/status.svg?organization=getcarrier&repository=dast)](https://hub.docker.com/r/getcarrier/dast/builds/)

### Quick and easy start
These simple steps will run blind DAST scan against your application and generate html and xml report with some low hanging fruits

##### 1. Install docker
 
##### 2. Start container and pass 5 config options to container and mount reports folder:

`host` - your application host (e.g. security.events.epam.com)

`port` - port your application is running at (e.g. 443)

`protocol` - http or https you are using

`project_name` - the name of your project will be displayed in reports

`environment` - name of environment you will be doing testing

`your_local_path_to_reports` - path on your local filesystem where you want to store reports from this execution

For example:

``` 
docker run -t -e host=localhost  -e port=443 -e protocol=https \
       -e project_name=MY_PET_PROJECT -e environment=stag \
       -v <your_local_path_to_reports>:/tmp/reports \
       --name=dusty --rm \
       getcarrier/dast:latest -s basic
```

##### 3. Open scan report
Report is located in your `your_local_path_to_reports` folder

### Configuration
Scans can be configured using `scan-config.yaml` file.

##### scan-config.yaml structure
```
basic: # Name of the scan
  # General configuration section
  target_host: $host          # host to scan (e.g. my.domain.com)
  target_port: $port          # port where it is hosted (e.g. 443)
  protocol: $protocol         # http or https

  # Qualys WAS integration in tricky and

    # Qualys scan profile

    # Qualys report temaple, probably we need to store example somewhere
    qualys_template_id: ID_OF_QUALYS_TEMPLATE 
    # Type of a scanner to use in Qualys
    qualys_scanner_type: INTERNAL | EXTERNAL 
    # In case you use INTERNAL you will need:
    qualys_scanner: NAME_OF_SCANNER
  
```
configuration can be mounted to container like 
```
-v <path_to_local_folder>/scan-config.yaml:/tmp/scan-config.yaml
```

##### False positive filtering configuration
User need to fill `false_positive.config` file with titles of false-positive issues and mount it to container
```
-v <path_to_local_folder>/false_positive.config:/tmp/false_positive.config
```

##### Please note that `scan-config.yaml` and `false_positive.config` included for demo purposes
